# Advent of Code 2022

## Personal Goal
My goal throughout this year's edition of the Advent of Code is to create a clean and maintenable solution for each challenge, using a test driven development approach.

A special attention is made to make the code readable and easily understandable. All the solutions are developped in .NET 7 with live unit testing.
